## 📌 Project Overview
This project utilizes **computer vision techniques** to track the motion of a basketball in real-time. It helps analyze player performance by tracking the ball's trajectory and movement patterns.

### 🔍 **Features**
- **Real-time Object Detection:** Tracks the basketball using **OpenCV** and **Color Filtering**.
- **Motion Analysis:** Captures movement data and provides **trajectory visualization**.
- **Automated Tracking:** Uses Python and OpenCV to process video data efficiently.

## 🚀 **Technology Stack**
- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **NumPy**
- **cvzone**
- **Color Filtering Techniques**

## 🛠 **Setup & Installation**
### 📥 Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy cvzone
